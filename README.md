# check_predicted.py
Nagios plugin that analyzes RRD files for real-time anomaly detection.

I'm currently reworking to run under check_mk/OMD in a more general case
since people seem to be interested in that sort of thing.

check_predicted.php is a crude pnp4nagios template for graphing.

Note: I keep my stuff in a private repo elsewhere. But I will make
occasional updates here.
